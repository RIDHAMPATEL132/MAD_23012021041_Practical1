# Practical 1

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
Develop a Kotlin program for demonstrating various programming concepts.

## ðŸ“– Description
This practical demonstrates the fundamental programming concepts in Kotlin by developing small programs.
Kotlin, being a modern and concise language for Android development, supports features like variables, data types, operators, control structures (if-else, when, loops), functions, classes, and collections.
By implementing these concepts in Kotlin programs, we gain a clear understanding of how logic is written, structured, and executed in Android applications as well as in general-purpose programming.

## ðŸ“‹ List of Practicals

| No. | Screenshot | Aim |
|-----|------------|-----|
| 1 | <img src="screenshots/p1.png" alt="Practical 1" width="200"/> | Program demonstrates how to declare variables of various data types in Kotlin (Int, Double, Float, Long, Short, Byte, Char, Boolean, String) and display their values. |
| 2 | <img src="screenshots/p2.png" alt="Practical 2" width="200"/> | This program shows conversion of one data type into another, such as Int â†’ Double, String â†’ Int, and String â†’ Double using Kotlin type conversion functions. |
| 3 | <img src="screenshots/p3.png" alt="Practical 3" width="200"/> | Takes input of student details like name, enrollment number, and branch, then displays the entered information. |
| 4 | <img src="screenshots/p4.1.png" alt="Practical 4" width="200"/><img src="screenshots/p4.2.png" alt="Practical 4" width="200"/> | Checks whether a given number is odd or even using control flow inside println() statement. |
| 5 | <img src="screenshots/p5.1.png" alt="Practical 5" width="200"/><img src="screenshots/p5.2.png" alt="Practical 5" width="200"/> | Uses Kotlin when expression to display the month name according to the number entered by the user (1â€“12). |
| 6 | <img src="screenshots/p6.png" alt="Practical 6" width="200"/> | Implements a custom function to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on two numbers. |
| 7 | <img src="screenshots/p7.png" alt="Practical 7" width="200"/> | Uses recursion to calculate the factorial of a given number by repeatedly calling the function until the base condition is met. |
| 8 | <img src="screenshots/p8.1.png" alt="Practical 8" width="200"/><img src="screenshots/p8.2.png" alt="Practical 8" width="200"/> | Explores array operations like Arrays.deepToString(), contentDeepToString(), and joinToString(). Demonstrates array creation, looping with range/until/downTo, and sorting arrays with and without built-in functions. |
| 9 | <img src="screenshots/p9.png" alt="Practical 9" width="200"/> | Stores integers in an ArrayList and finds the maximum value using iteration and built-in functions. |
| 10 | <img src="screenshots/p10.png" alt="Practical 10" width="200"/> | Defines a Car class with attributes like type, model, price, owner, and miles driven. Implements methods to display car info, calculate original price, and compute depreciated price. |
| 11 | <img src="screenshots/p11.png" alt="Practical 11" width="200"/> | Demonstrates Kotlin operator overloading by defining a Matrix class that supports matrix addition, subtraction, and multiplication. The toString() method is overloaded for formatted matrix output. |

## âœ… Conclusion
The Kotlin program was successfully developed to demonstrate various programming concepts such as variables, data types, control structures, functions, and object-oriented features.
This practical helped in understanding the fundamentals of Kotlin programming and how these concepts can be applied in developing Android as well as general-purpose applications.
