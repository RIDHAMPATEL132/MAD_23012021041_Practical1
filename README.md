# Practical 1

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
Develop a Kotlin program for demonstrating various programming concepts.

## ðŸ“– Description
This practical demonstrates the fundamental programming concepts in Kotlin by developing small programs.
Kotlin, being a modern and concise language for Android development, supports features like variables, data types, operators, control structures (if-else, when, loops), functions, classes, and collections.
By implementing these concepts in Kotlin programs, we gain a clear understanding of how logic is written, structured, and executed in Android applications as well as in general-purpose programming.
